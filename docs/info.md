## How it works

The QIF is a nonlinear circuit that integrates the square of the output with the input and resets from a peak value to a lower value.

## How to test

Input a positive 8-bit vector and set the clock, and reset, and it should spike.

## External hardware

I would use an ADLAM200 for the test vectors.
